# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I felt quite confident when using comparison operators because these work exactly the same as in the other programming languages I am familiar with. The only differences are in the formatting, which just take a little practice.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I also felt pretty comfortable with logical operators. These work the same as in Java, with some minor formatting differences (Ruby seems to be more forgiving in this regard
)
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
If-statements are an area where I feel very comfortable. I have written quite a few programs in Java and C that use much more complex if-statements.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
We went over most of the conditionals lesson during our live lecture, and nothing was really new here for me. I was able to do all of the exercises in 15 minutes or so after that. Again, this is an area where I have a lot of prior experience.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think the formatting of Ruby is the primary area where I need more practice. All of my issues so far have been because I didn't use correct formatting (not really errors in logic yet).

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No questions currently, but I would go to my group first if I did have one.
